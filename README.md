## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

> It is an honor to be able to live in such a digital age. Through the Internet, people who are almost impossible to meet in real life can gather together to exchange knowledge and help each other.

Like the others here, I am also a programmer, currently mainly engaged in front-end development. I used Bytefish as my pen name, which means to swim in the digital ocean like a fish. As for my real name, it doesn't matter.
